# Repo for Coursera Data Science Capstone Course Project
The goals of this final assimgnment are to:

- create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that I have built 

- provide an interface that can be accessed by others. 

For this project, i prepared and submitted:

1. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
2. A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.
3. the source code on github



This repository contains the ui.R and server.R files for the developed Shiny Application as well as the RStudio Presenter files for the Data Science Capstone Course Project.

The developed Shiny app for the the assignment is available at:
